<p>  
I like to believe that my strength this year and from previous years has been my ability to take different perspectives creativly and analytically. This helps me while analyzing documents for essays, and in reading for homework. This strength has remained constant in those categories throughout this year. For example, this skill has aided me in my Nature essay on thr Scarlett Letter, when I discussed different aspects and applications of nature, and whilke annotating Give Me Liberty.
