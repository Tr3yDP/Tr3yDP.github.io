        My BIGGEST stretch so far this year has been making a plan of action for my work. What i mean by this is that I always save it for the last day and get really stressed. Even Though I know that certain assignments will take a long time, I procrastinate anyway. An example of this is sometimes my Odyssey homework. If I don't finish all of the work in class, which isn't too often, it gets done usually the night before. This stretch has remained constant throughout this year because that seems to be when I get the most work done. A way I have begun to work out of procrastination is on my history annotations. Since they would takes hours to complete on the last day, I usually do some on the @nd to last day to get some out of the way.
