    My goal this year has been to improve my writing and essays. By the end of the year, I would hope that I have improved my thesis statements and my analysis. I have been working on my thesis sdtatemnents since the beginning of the year and have seen improvement. In my Nature essay on the Scarlett Letter, I wrote what I think to be a pretty good thesis compared to previous work.

      <h2>Mid-Year Reflection
      </h2>
     <ul>
         <li> 
I think that some of my stretches are becoming strengths as time goes on. I am now gaining an understanding of what to say in my thesis statements and am writing better theses.</li>




        <li> While writing my Scarlet Letter essay on nature, I felt that my thesis statement writing was improving compared to what I was doing before. Also, on the essay on the connecticut compromise, I think that I wrote one of my best thesis statements.</li>


        <li> I think that my friend group is very broad inside and outside of school. I think in most usual situations, I accept people easily that come into my life. I think that the best thing to do is not to gain any enemies because that is when problems can evolve.</li>


        <li>I have become more of a leader at baseball practices and tournaments. This has helped me as a person and has helped me to reach out to new people.</li>


        <li>I have completed and turned in most of the homework and assignments that I have received. I have only a few missing assignments from a while ago that are only worth about half of a percent, so they are of no use by now.</li>


        <li>I am proud of my most recent spanish project because the video turned out good and I only had to use the dictionary a few times. I also think that my history annotations are a good example of my work as well.</li>
